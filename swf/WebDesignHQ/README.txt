WebDesignHQ.com Flash Enabled PHP-Nuke Theme
Created by Jared Alberghini (http://www.webdesignhq.com)

This PHP-Nuke theme replaces the Logo, Slogan, and Block Titles with dynamic Flash files.

To Install: simply upload the WebDesignHQ folder to your nuke/themes/ directory.

You don't need to upload the .fla source files, those are there in case you want to 
change the look of the Flash files.

No php files were hurt during the creation of this theme.
No hardcoded colors are used in this theme.
If you would like to change the color scheme, just change the variables at the very beginning of theme.php.
All font calls are CSS based.  If you would like to change the style of your site, edit the styles/style.css file.
