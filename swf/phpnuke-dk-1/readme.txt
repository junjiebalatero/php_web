This theme is made on the basis on the Amigoz.net and the Nitrogen themes.
Mr. Hemp, the original designer of Amigoz.net made some changes to the banner section, and I changed some of the original images from Nitrogen and added some extra changes. 
However this version is not coded for the Netscape, but if there is a need for it, it will probably be made soon.
The theme is still a little messy but certainly functional. It's still in testing so any comments would be welcome.
