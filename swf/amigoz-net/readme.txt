  This theme is based on the unreleased NiTr0gEn theme (http://www.gconcepts.net - thanks to lykwid).

  Since this is my first attempt on themes don't expect too much.

  Some changes have to be made on the mainfile.php and sections.php to this theme work correctly
  with message boxes and when showing sections articles.

  It will not change anything when showing another theme. This is just some code optimization.
  You can download the new files at http://www.amigoz.net

  This new version (1.1) validates HTML 4.01 Transitional and CSS2, and was tested with Netscape, Opera, IE and Mozilla.


-=[ INSTALLATION ]=-

  -=- Unzip amigoz-net.zip on your themes folder.
  -=- If you want to disable the topbar edit topbar.php.
  -=- If your site is on a subdomain (http://www.yoursite.domain.com) or in a folder (http://www.domain.com/yoursite) You'll need to edit style.css under themes/amigoz-net/style/ folder.
	Change all lines:
       background-image : url(/themes/amigoz-net/images/image.gif)

	to:
       background-image : url(http://[URL]/themes/amigoz-net/images/image.gif)

  where [URL] is the full address to you site.
