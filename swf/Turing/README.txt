* Originally based on www.ilveneto.net's Theme, updated for Post-Nuke
  and then merged with the PostNuke theme to be less image-dependant
  and hopefully more usable.

* As of this version, the Theme is completely CSS and HTML 4.0 compliant.

* Included are a few extra graphics, namedly down-logo.gif and web.gif.
  The PHP Nuke originals are not tranparent and thus look crappy.

Enjoy!
